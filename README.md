# ruff-landing
It was a really rough ride to this landing page.
Super Thankful that I survived and get a chance to grow with you.
My learning curve was more like a line to stack bricks on.
My brick stacking skills improved to the tune of 100 stacked.
100 repos nicely stacked in my github account, KingMe9956.
0 deployed, published, hosted, pushed, audited or earning me $.
Most of them are public so if you dare to enter the madness do so at your own risk. 
All contributions are extremely appreciated. 
More than anything, Thank You for your support and understanding.
After 3 years it is hard to pay the basics but very easy to ask for help learning them. 
To anyone else out there totally lost you are not alone. Keep trying you will git it. 💪 LOL
Any advice or links that might help would be great. 
Have a good good day everyone. 

My Moto= 🌈🌈's and 🍭🍭's.
When we all share, WE ALL WIN.                love you boys💪😘
